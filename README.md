# AHK 2D Triggerbot (kinda)
Garbage AHK triggerbot for those 2D aim practice games. 
This thing just clicks for you when color under cursor changes, basic stuff.

Hold [T] key to keep that triggerbot active, or you can just change it to whatever you want (line 25, first parameter in GetKeyState).

### To-do list
 idk it's good enought atm lmao
